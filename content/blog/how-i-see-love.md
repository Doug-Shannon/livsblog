# How I See Love

How do I see love? Well to start a lot of people think love as being kind and caring for each other that’s not what I think it means. Do you ever think about when you say I love you to someone, well most people don’t notice whed they say that what it means to me is  An intense feeling of deep affection_

so lets say I went up to one of my old friends when they did something nice for me and I said I ove you so you have an intense feeling of affection for an old friend that only did one nice thing well theres probably a reason you guys dont hang out anymore so you should probably just stick with thankyou that was really nice of you.....now the only reason I brought that up was one of my old friends did that to me a couple days ago and it made me start thinking why would someoned say "I love you" if you only dId something nice for them plus they're just old friends

my second example is, lets say you just like someone its the first day you like them kinda but then you find out that he or she likes you back so you say you love he or she well thats not the best choice...let me explain just what if the very next day your like eh i dont like this person anymore I like this different person and this same thing repeats again, again, and again over and over so i know for a fact if thats happening then you dont love this person you probably dont even like this person you just think they're cute. do you want more ok....

this would be an example of love say you do foster care and you get a little girl/boy and you just like them and everything beacuse they're cute and sweet and you get to take care of them but then this child is like a part of your family so you start to love them like they're in your family well thats an example of love and I hope you learned some things from this blog of how I see love
